# 🐄 DairyIQ – Milk Quality Prediction System

**DairyIQ** is a machine learning-powered web application that predicts the quality of milk based on chemical and physical properties such as pH, temperature, fat content, conductivity, and density.

Developed using:

- 🧠 scikit-learn for machine learning
- 🔥 Flask for the web backend
- 🎨 HTML/CSS for the frontend
- 📒 Jupyter Notebook for model prototyping

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Predicts **High** or **Low** milk quality
- 🧪 Interactive web form for input
- 📈 Built-in machine learning model (`RandomForestClassifier`)
- 🧠 Model saved and reused via `joblib`
- 💻 Easy to run locally

## ✅ To Do / Future Improvements

- [ ] Add confidence score or visual gauge
- [ ] Log user inputs and predictions
- [ ] Deploy on Render or PythonAnywhere
- [ ] Add charts/graphs to report trends
- [ ] PDF export of prediction reports
